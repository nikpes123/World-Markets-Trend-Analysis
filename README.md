## ⚙️ Virtual Environment Setup
To ensure a proper working environment for stock market analysis, follow these steps to set up your virtual environment and Jupyter kernel.

### **1️⃣ Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)*
(Optional, but highly recommended to avoid dependency conflicts.)
```bash*
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
source .venv/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔍 Project Structure
```plaintext
📂 stock-analysis-project
│-- 📂 data/                  # Raw and processed stock data
│-- 📂 notebooks/             # Jupyter Notebooks for analysis
